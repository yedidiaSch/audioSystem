/**
 * @class ADSREnvelope
 * @brief ADSR envelope generator for amplitude modulation
 * 
 * Implements a classic ADSR envelope that shapes audio signals over time:
 * - Attack: Time to reach maximum amplitude when note starts
 * - Decay: Time to fall from peak to sustain level
 * - Sustain: Level maintained while note is held
 * - Release: Time to fade to silence when note ends
 * 
 * The envelope provides smooth amplitude changes to prevent clicks
 * and create natural-sounding note articulation.
