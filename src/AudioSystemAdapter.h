/**
 * @class AudioSystemAdapter
 * @brief Adapter that connects the audio system to the observer 
 *
 * This class implements the Adapter design pattern to allow an AudioSystem
 * instance to receive notifications through the Observer pattern. It wraps
 * an AudioSystem object and translates incoming notifications (MIDI events)
 * into appropriate calls to the AudioSystem.
 *
 * The adapter serves as a bridge between components that emit events and
 * the audio system that needs to respond to those events, decoupling the
 * event sources from the audio processing logic.
